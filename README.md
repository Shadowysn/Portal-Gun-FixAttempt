# Portal-Gun-FixAttempt
 
An unfinished attempt to edit the Portal Gun.

I made the main weapon able to be only-blue-portal or only-orange-portal in the Portal maps, without usage of the portal_portalonly ConVar.
They can also now fire portals when not held by a player instead of LUA erroring, but the portals still don't fit in the portal-grills.

Atlas' Portal Gun is unspawnable from menu, but can be given with the console command:
give weapon_portalgun_atlas
This is because Atlas' PG is unfinished and buggy, due to it being an attempt to ACTUALLY base it off weapon_portalgun with SWEP.Base, not directly copying the code over.

Not really recommended for non-developer usage.
