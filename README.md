# Portal-Gun-FixAttempt
 
An unfinished attempt to edit the Portal Gun.

Atlas' Portal Gun is unspawnable from menu, but can be given with the console command:
give weapon_portalgun_atlas
Atlas' PG is unfinished and a bit buggy, due to it being an attempt to ACTUALLY base it off weapon_portalgun with SWEP.Base
